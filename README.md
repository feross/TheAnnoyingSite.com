## What is this?

This is the GitHub repo that goes along with the talk I gave at [dotJS 2017](https://www.dotjs.io/) in Paris, France.

**Talk Title:**

The Annoying Site a.k.a. "The Power of the Web Platform"

**Alternative Title:**

The Worst Webpage in the World

**Talk description:**

This is a fun and playful talk where we'll learn about many different web platform features that provide great power to web developers. What if we used that power for evil? What kind of terrible UX could we create if our goal was to build the worst site in the world?

There will be live coding, many demos, and lots of fun with legacy web platform APIs!
